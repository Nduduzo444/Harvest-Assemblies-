            <p class="lead">
                Harvest Assemblies of Christ Global Church was founded in 2008 in the heart of Phase 5, a vibrant community seeking spiritual renewal and purpose. Under the divine calling and leadership of <strong>Apostle Malesela</strong>, the church began as a humble gathering of believers in a small hall, united by faith, prayer, and a vision for transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                From its earliest days, the church has been a beacon of hope — preaching the gospel, nurturing families, and empowering youth through outreach, worship, and discipleship. What started with just a handful of passionate souls has grown into a thriving global ministry, touching lives across South Africa and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, Harvest Assemblies has launched dynamic ministries including the <em>Harvest Youth Fire</em>, <em>Women of Grace</em>, and <em>Kingdom Builders Men's Fellowship</em>. Our annual conferences, healing crusades, and community upliftment programs have become pillars of impact and inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we continue to walk boldly in our calling — raising leaders, restoring families, and reaching nations. Our foundation is Christ, our mission is harvest, and our future is filled with glory.
            </p>
