    <p class="lead">
      Harvest Assemblies of Christ Global Church is more than a place of worship — it's a spiritual home, a training ground for leaders, and a beacon of hope in the community. Established in <strong>2008</strong> in Phase 5, Palmridge, Katlehong, the church was founded by <strong>Apostle D&P Malesela</strong> with a divine mandate to raise a generation of harvesters for the Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our headquarters is located at <strong>15845 Lengana Street, Palmridge, Katlehong, Gauteng</strong>. From this humble corner of Johannesburg, our ministry has grown to impact lives across South Africa and beyond — through healing crusades, youth empowerment, women's conferences, and outreach missions.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit, the authority of Scripture, and the urgency of the harvest. Our services are filled with passionate worship, prophetic teaching, and a deep commitment to community transformation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you're seeking healing, purpose, or a deeper walk with God — there's a place for you here.
